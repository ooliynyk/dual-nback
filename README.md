# Dual N-Back game

The subject is presented with a sequence of stimuli, and the task consists of indicating when the current stimulus matches the one from n steps earlier in the sequence. 
The load factor n can be adjusted to make the task more or less difficult.

To clarify, the visual n-back test is similar to the classic memory game of "Concentration". 
However, instead of different items that are in a fixed location on the game board, there is only one item, that appears in different positions on the game board during each turn. 
"1-N" means that you have to remember the position of the item, one turn back. 
"2-N" means that you have to remember the position of the item two turns back, and so on.
